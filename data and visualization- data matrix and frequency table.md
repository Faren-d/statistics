# Data matrix and frequency table

For example, you are interested in top football competition in Spain (Primera Division):

- The cases are the individual foodtball players within the league. The variables are including age, etc.

The best way to order all htis information is by means of a "data matrix" as shown below:

- The values that are displayed in the cells of this table are usually called observations.

You need the data matrix for all your statistical analyzes. However, you usually do not present your complete data matrix to other people.

 Because :
 
 It is often huge. 
 
It doesn't give a clear overview of the statistical information.

Therefore, we use

So, we do it by Frequency table:

but for quantitative variables like below, we do different. First look at the following table:

For the weight variable in this example, it doesn't make sense to compute percentages for every specific value of weight. Because then we would end up with a countless number of categories. This doesn't give a good overview because it barely tells you more than the original data matrix.

What researchers usually do to solve that problem is building new ordinal categories by using intervals. You can see in the follwoing image:

Thtough this way you lose information. But the advantage is that you get a much better overview. So, we say we recoded the variable:

It is very easy to recode quantitative variables into ordinal ones. However,you cannot recode ordinal variables into quantitative ones.
