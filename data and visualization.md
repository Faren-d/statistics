### Variables and Cases:

How statistics can be applied to understand different things such as sport?

- Variables are features of something or someone. In other words, a variable is a characteristic of a case that can vary.

- Cases are something or someone. In other owrds, a case is the subject of the data, such as football players or teams.

#### Examples: 
  ● Cases: individual football players, football teams, companies, schools, or countries.
  ● Variables: body weight, hair color, age, number of goals scored, city where the team is based, main shirt colors.


  In the following image, VARIABLES are the characteristics of each individual and each individual is a CASE.

  In the following imgae, individuals are not cases. The teams are cases of this example.

 Variables need to vary.

For example: When the teams are all Spanish, then there is no variation for the country. So, we call this characteristic as CONSTANT and not as VARIABLE

### Levels of Measurement
There are many many kinds of variables. So, it is essential to distinguish different levels of measurement.
1. Categorical Variables
   
● Nominal Variables: Different categories with no order or ranking.

○ Examples: nationality, gender, city of the team.

● Ordinal Variables: Categories with a clear order but unknown differences between them.

○ Example: Order of teams in a competition (1st, 2nd, 3rd) – the difference in performance between each rank isn't clear.

2. Quantitative Variables

● Interval Variables: Ordered categories with equal intervals between them, but no meaningful zero point.

○ Example: Age of a football player – the difference between 18 and 16 is the same as between 14 and 12, but an age of 0 doesn't mean "no age."

● Ratio Variables: Similar to interval but with a meaningful zero point.

○ Example: Player's height – a height of 0 cm means "no height.”

Quantitative Variables can be distinguished in two types: 

● Discrete Variables: Separate, distinct values with no values in between.

○ Example: Number of goals scored – a player can score 1 or 2 goals, not 1.21 goals.

● Continuous Variables: Values can fall anywhere within a range.
○ Example: Player's height – a player can be 170 cm, 171 cm, or 170.2461 cm tall.

Importance of Levels of Measurement

● The appropriate statistical analysis depends on the level of measurement of the variables.

● In practice, the distinction between interval and ratio levels is often less important.

● Ordinal variables with many categories can sometimes be treated as quantitative.

○ Example: Survey question asking to rate a player on a scale of 0 to 10.

How Understanding These Concepts Helps

● Understanding cases, variables, and levels of measurement brings structure to sports knowledge.

● It allows for more systematic and meaningful analysis of data, leading to better insights.
